# Stottie

Makes 1 large stottie.

## Ingredients

- 6 fl.oz. Milk
- 8 oz. White Bread Flour

## Method

1. Put the milk and the margarine into the breadmaker.
1. Add the flour.
1. Add the sugar, yeast and salt, keeping the yeast and salt separate.
1. Mix on a knead only program. I use a pasta dough program which warms and kneads for 13 minutes and then stops.
1. Take out the dough which will probably be dry but quite sticky.
1. Press out to a flat disk about 1½ to 2 cm thick.
1. Make a hole in the centre.
1. Cover and leave to rise for 1 to 2 hours.
1. Bake at 200°C for 15 minutes.
1. Turn off the oven, turn the bread over and leave in the cooling oven for another 5 minutes.
