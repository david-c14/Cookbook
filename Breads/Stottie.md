## Ingredients

- 350g White Bread Flour
- 100ml Hot water
- mixed with 
- 100ml Cold Milk
- A little extra cold water
- ¼ tsp Sugar
- 3g Yeast for Bread Machines
- Salt to taste

## Method

1. Put the dry ingredients into a bowl, taking care to keep the yeast and salt separate
1. Add the liquid.
1. Mix into a dough, ideally with an electric mixer using dough hooks. Gradually adding extra cold water until the dough just comes together
1. Keep mixing until the dough is smooth and elastic. It should stiff and not at all sticky.
1. Shape into either 1 or 2 rough balls and cover loosely
1. Allow to rise until doubled in size, an hour or more in a warm place.
1. Roll each ball to a flat round disk ¾" thick.
1. Flour the end of the rolling pin and use it to form a deep depression in the centre of the disk
1. Turn the oven on to 200ºC.  The dough only proves once, so allow it to rest while the oven heats up, but it should not stand for more than 10 minutes.
1. Bake for 15 minutes. Turn off the oven, turn the loaves over and allow to cool in the hot oven.
