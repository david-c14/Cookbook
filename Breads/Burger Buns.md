# Burger Buns

Makes 4 large or 6 small - takes 2½ hours

These buns are enriched with milk, butter and egg resulting in something superficially similar to trendy brioche-style buns. But they are not true brioche at all.

## Ingredients

- 1 Medium Egg
- 100ml Milk
- 225g Strong White Flour
- ½ tsp Sugar
- 50g Butter
- 1 tsp Easyblend Yeast
- Salt to taste

---

- 1 tbsp milk to glaze

## Method

1. Put the wet ingredients in the breadmaker
1. Add the dry ingredients taking care to keep the yeast and salt separate.
1. Run a dough cycle
1. Weigh the dough and divide into 4 or 6 equal parts. Typically 70-75g each for small buns on 110g each for large.
1. Roll each part into a tight ball using a cupped hand on a lightly oiled surface
1. Place the rolls fairly close together on a prepared baking sheet, and cover loosely
1. Allow to rise for 1 - 1½ hours
1. Glaze with milk if a shiny golden finish is desired
1. Bake for 15 minutes in a pre-heated oven at 200°C
